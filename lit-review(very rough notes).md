# Thesis notes

## Some terms

- Planetesimals -> solid body formed by accretion, in its early stages.
- Circumstellar disc -> a ring-shaped accretion disk of matter.
- Protoplanetary disc -> Circumstellar disc but around a newly formed star.
- protoplanet -> a planet at very early stages of becoming a planet.

## Isotopes

$^{27}\text{Al}$ is stable, and $^{26}\text{Al}$ is radioactive isotope.
$^{24}\text{Mg}$ is most abundant stable.
$^{26}\text{Mg}$ is stable isotope.

$^{26}\text{Al}$(hf ~0.717 myr) & $^{60}\text{Fe}$(hf ~2.6 myr) are important while considering thermal energy.

>$^{26}\text{Al}$ -> $^{26}\text{Mg}$ 
>$^{60}\text{Fe}$ ->-> $^{60}\text{Ni}$

After the complete decay of Al, to get its presence before decay we use the ratios comparison of $^{26}\text{Mg} / ^{24}\text{Mg}$ and $^{27}\text{Al} / ^{24}\text{Mg}$ in the minerals.

$^{26}\text{Al}$ is for quick heating(relatively speaking, it was imp as it was releasing energy when the planetesimals were still young) and $^{60}\text{Fe}$ helps in maintaining that elevated temp after all the $^{26}\text{Al}$ is decayed.


## Vesta

Formed just after few myr after the solar system formation with rapid accretion.

HED (howardites, eucrites, and diogenites) meteorites are considered to be originated from Vesta. Diogenites are derived from the lower crust or upper mantle, eucrites comes from basaltic surface flows or shallow intrusions.


Vesta is a differentiated asteroid with metallic core, silicate mantle, and basaltic crust.
