In the initial period of formation of solar system, the bodies formed was mainly made from primitive solar system materials (mix of high and low melting temp silicates and metal rich phases including sulfides).

To generate large-scale melting, the potential energy from collision between objects is not enough, if there is an early accretion in solar system history, the short lived radioactive elements (like <sup>26</sup>Al, <sup>60</sup>Fe) have to potential to raise the temp above eutectic point of metal sulfide and above the solidus of the silicate fraction,(~1300 K). For smaller bodies(<1000 Km diameters) the pressure will be low (so the temp will be between ~1300 K to liquidus, partial melt) so that it forms a complex system of solid metal matrix and solid silicates with two non mixing liquids(molten metal rich sulfide & silicate melt)
